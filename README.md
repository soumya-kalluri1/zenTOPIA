Meditation, sleep tracking, scheduling app

  This app is dedicated to increasing the quality of mental health by promoting meditation and self-care practices. While there are 
currently many meditation apps, individuals often times cannot find the time to meditate in their schedule. However, our app focuses
on a more holistic approach, accomodating short meditative practices in however much free time individuals may have. Additionally, it is
also attuned to the individual's emotional state based on physical cues from wearable sensors. By using these three items together,
zenTOPIA helps people have a more sustainable, healthier, and happier lifestyle.
