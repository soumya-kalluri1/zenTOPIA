Instructions on how to get different data at different times of the day.

Files needed: TrackDay.java, TrackHour.java, TrackMinute.java

You should have a text file that contains data in this format:
    yearmonthday,hour:minute,heart rate,movement

    example:
    20190406,19:18,65,10

The data is in CSV format, so the first line should indicate which column
comtains which data, so the first line of every data file that we have should
look exactly like this:
    day,time,heart rate,movement

An example of the contents of a whole file of data:
    day,time,heart rate,movement
    20190406,19:18,65,10
    20190406,19:19,65,9
    20190406,19:20,64,9
    20190406,19:21,64,9
    20190406,19:22,65,9

Each file represents one day of data, so the first column of data should be
exactly the same, since that represents the day and the day should be the
same for all of them.


To use this data, go into your Java file and create a TrackDay object.
The constructor takes one argument, a string, which is the name of the file
containing the data you want to read.
    example:
    TrackDay april7 = new TrackDay("myFile.txt");
Also note that we're using a Scanner to read from the file, so you will have
to handle the possible IOException that may be thrown if that file can't be
found.

From there, you can get the heart rate and the movement at a specific time
from that day, if there is data for that time.
The methods to do this are 'getHeartRateAt()' and 'getMovementAt()'. Both take
2 integers as parameters the first being the hour and the second being the
minute. These are the method signatures:
        public int getHeartRateAt(int hour, int minute)
        public int getMovementAt(int hour, int minute)
These are both non-static methods in the TrackDay class, so you would call them
on the TrackDay object that represents the day you want and specify the time
with the hour and minute parameters.

The methods will return the heart rate or the movement at that time
(respectively). If no data exists for that time, the method will return -1.
